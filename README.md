# solar-angles-calculator-for-maximizing-solar-panel-efficiency

The **Solar Angles Calculator** is a sophisticated tool designed to help optimize the efficiency of solar panels by calculating essential solar angles. With the increasing importance of renewable energy, accurately positioning solar panels to capture maximum sunlight is crucial. This application leverages the power of Python and Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for computing various solar angles that are fundamental in the setup and orientation of solar panels.

By inputting the date, time, and geographic coordinates, users can obtain precise values for the following angles:
- Hour Angle
- Declination Angle
- Solar Altitude Angle
- Sunset Sunrise Angle
- Zenith Angle
- Solar Azimuth Angle

These calculations are vital for determining the optimal tilt and orientation of solar panels, thereby enhancing their performance and energy output. The application also includes error handling to ensure that the input values are within the appropriate domain, providing a seamless user experience.
